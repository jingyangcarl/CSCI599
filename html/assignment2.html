		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>For this assignment, you will be implementing Structure from Motion. 
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivision_surface#Loop_subdivision_surface">Feature Matching</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./garland/Papers/quadrics.pdf">Structure from Motion</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./garland/Papers/quadrics.pdf">Fuse (Optional)</a></li>
			</ul>
			We have made available a visualization tool using the Three.js library implemented in "./js/assignment2.js" and an example implementation located in "./assignments/assignment2.py". Your objective is to create implementations for both "subdivision_loop" and "simplify_quadric_error". You are encouraged to use a programming language with which you are comfortable. The output results should be in the ply format, and you must visualize your outcomes accordingly. 
			<br><br>
			<b>How to Submit: </b>Please submit this template file along with your implementation as a zip file. The zip file should contain your source code, the generated results in PLY mesh format, and a report that has been modified using this HTML file. The report should comprise your results and a concise explanation of your implementation. Alternatively, you may choose to create a GitHub repository containing all these elements and provide a link for submission.
			<br><br>
			<b>Grading: </b>The grading is based on the correctness of your implementation. You are encouraged to use the visualization tool to debug your implementation. You can also use the visualization tool to test your implementation on other 3D models. You can find an example of 3D model in the "./assets" folder.</p>
